## Minor fixes

- 🐛 Fixed issue where the start time of the exam display wrongly. [#92](https://github.com/iiumschedule/iium_schedule/issues/92)
  - _I arrived early at the exam venue because I thought the exam starts at 2pm 😂. No wonder no people come yet at that time. Aiyaa final year final semester student already... 🤦‍♂️_
- 🐛 The exam now will mark as finished only after the exam ends (+3 hrs from the start time). [#93](https://github.com/iiumschedule/iium_schedule/issues/93)
