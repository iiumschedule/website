## Highlight

‚ú® New feature: **Final exams** schedule!

The final exams can be added manually, or imported from i-Ma'luum. The neat part is, you
can add the exams into your own calendar (Google, Outlook etc), so you can set up notification etc.

The `.ics` ICalendar file is also generated, so you can share it with your friends or transfer to your PC etc.

Closing this issue [#66](https://github.com/iqfareez/iium_schedule/issues/66) for now. Also, again, thanks to [Aiman Rahim](https://plashspeed-aiman.github.io/) that added POC
for adding items to calendar events in his PR [#64](https://github.com/iqfareez/iium_schedule/pull/64)

While we are on this topic, what do you think if we add ability to **export class timetable** to calendar also?
Leave a thumbs in [here (Issue #65)](https://github.com/iqfareez/iium_schedule/issues/65) if you think it's a good idea üëç
