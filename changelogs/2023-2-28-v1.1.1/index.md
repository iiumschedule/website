## What's New

- :lipstick: Redesigned **subject viewer** - Replaced the dialog with a full page (Only for saved schedule, for unsaved subject, the dialog remains)
  - Why? Because previously, when using dialog and user want to edit, the dialog will [glitch a bit](https://imgur.com/YE3S3AP.mp4). It was caused due to the widget rebuilds. This is bad for the UX, hence this changes. Plus, it looks nicer to the eyes too (in my opinion lah..)

- :iphone: **Responsive layout** - Adapt for wide screen devices (eg desktop or tablet) - this is just the beginning, I'm planning to _responsivenessify_ (make responsive) of other UI elements.

- :heavy_plus_sign: Upgrade dependencies
- :wrench: Exposes option to increase/decrease schedule text sizes for all platforms. For small screen devices, the option will be in the overflow menu. [[Screenshot]](https://imgur.com/vCZesI9.png)

## Known issues
